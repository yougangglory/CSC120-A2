What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

<!-- Firsly, I had a hard time understanding what was the reason of the assigment and what I needed to do especially because the code was long and I had many stereotypes : i had already put in my head that I won't be capable to do it. What worked for me was that the program had no errors . What didn't work for me is that I wasn't capable to edit the main to run it and I almost dropped the class because of the stereotype that I had in my head of not being capable to do it. An advice I can give to someone taking this course is to know that, the homeworks will not always be easy, but don't drop because of that, seek for help, try by your own and do your best and then go to the TA hours to verify your work and get more help. Self-motivate yourself.  -->
